# Face detector notifier

A system that sends an email with an image attached if a face appears on camera.

# How to run

`python face_detector.py`

A stream of the camera will appear. When a face be detected, it will send and email in background.

Change the variable `frequency` in `face_detector.py` to the minimal amount of minutes you want between each email.

And edit the `config.json` file to provide the `sender email` (the email the images will be sent from -it has to be a valid Gmail which you are able to login in using the very same email and password you provided), the `sender password` and the `receiver email` (the email address where the images will be sent to).

### Attention

DO NOT set the `frequenty` to zero or remove any limitations on that. It will cause the software to send an email for each frame where a face was detected. It could be a lot of e-mails and sending to much emails at once certantly is not a good idea.
